# **Assessment Task 1  - UX Design**
### **By Luca Pritchard**
--- 
# **Design brief**
I want to create an interactive website with videos, charts, excerpts from the book and all things related to the dune universe. It will be semi-based off of the appendix of the book which shows things like the religions from Dune and the made up words used in the book. My target audience is someone similar to me who is interested in anything about dune whether it's the characters, ecology, religion, philosophy, etc. 
Book Choice and justification
## **Identify the name of the book and author**
Dune - By Frank Herbert 
## **Summarise what the book is about**
Dune, set roughly 20,000 years in the future in a vast futuristic empire,  follows a young boy named Paul; who is the heir of house Atreides, one of the 4 royal houses of the “Landsraad.” The planet Arrakis, nicknamed ‘Dune’ is the most important planet in the universe because it's the only source of ‘Melange’ or the spice. The spice allows for space travel, makes you smarter and lives longer (and smells like cinnamon.) The Emperor is upset with house atreides for gaining too much power so he gives them control of Arrakis in an elaborate plot to defeat them.
## **Explain why you chose this book**
One thing I particularly enjoy about dune is how in depth the Author frank herbert went into fleshing out all aspects of the world, the ecology and science, the politics, the history, the religion, etc. I also like the themes/ideas the book explores eg. how environments impact us, human psychology & thought, power & suffering. Finally I just like the main character and enjoy his journey throughout the book
# **User Experience Type** 
## **Identify what format your project will take**
I’m aiming for my project to be a website created using Figma, however it will be extremely interactive and contain videos, graphs, etc. 
It would look kind of similar to the “current publicly disclosable information” from attack on titan
## **Explain how this format will enhance the story or themes of the book**
By creating an interactive website with videos and graphs, I aim to provide the information from a wikipedia or encyclopedia while maintaining the enjoyableness and engagement of a game or youtube video. 

# **Target audience**
## **Identify the intended audience (Age group, interests, reading level, etc.)**
People of any age who are interested in either Dune, psychology, philosophy, science, language, etc. I think it would be very difficult to appeal to someone who has no interest in dune / hasn’t watched or read it. 
## **Explain why this project will appeal to them**
Because they will get access to an extremely detailed analysis about a book they are interested in a fun and engaging way. It will be more informative and in-depth than other sources while also aiming to be engaging with good aesthetics and charts / games
##  **Explain how your design choices will cater to this audience**
By creating a very sleek looking, easy to navigate and appealing menu, users are more likely to engage with my product. Also, by having charts / interactive features the user will get a richer understanding of the science and technology behind dune.
# **Software And tools**
## **List the software, platforms, and tools you plan to use**
I plan to use Figma to design the website prototype and interactive features and I will also be creating graphics and designs in procreate. Finally when putting videos in my website I will be using Premiere Rush
## **Explain why each of the above are suitable for your project**
Figma - Since figma is free with education accounts and offers hundreds of pre-made templates for designs such as buttons, charts and various other UI features. 
Procreate - I prefer procreate over other software because I have a lot of experience using it before and I already have a lot of pre-downloaded brush sets I've found over time. Also I like the UI and find it easy to use.
Premiere Rush - Rush has been my go to for making any video / movie project for school over the past 3 years. It’s easy for me to navigate through and is made to be very convenient with transitions and what not.

## **Evaluate each branch by considering its feasibility, impact, and effectiveness**
### **Aesthetics -**
 Through the aid of programs like figma and procreate, I believe it to be entirely feasible for me to complete this branch, things like colour palettes and such will be fairly easy to complete and are crucial in making the viewer enjoy the website.
### **Key Themes / Information -**
 As you may expect, without the key themes and information from dune I cannot deliver on my project's purpose and create an enjoyable learning resource. It will be the easiest and simplest to complete but it may be time consuming transferring information from other sources to my website.
### **Engagement / interactivity -**
 this will most likely be the hardest part of the project to realise as creating fully fledged videos / charts of a high standard will be difficult. Despite this I think I can still do it with the aid of programs such as premiere Rush.

# **Requirements Outline**
## **Functional Requirements**





Purpose of the Application

Describe what the app will do (e.g., "The app will allow users to explore book characters through interactive profiles").

Explain whether the app is designed to promote the book or engage fans within its genre.

Use Cases

Identify at least four key user interactions (e.g., "Users will select a character to view their backstory" or "Users can participate in a genre-themed quiz").

Include a brief user journey for each use case, explaining how users will navigate the app.

Test Cases (Planned)

Outline expected behaviours of the user experience (e.g., "When the user selects 'Start Quiz,' the app will display the first question").

Describe how you will test these features later (e.g., peer testing or self-testing).

Provide at least four examples
